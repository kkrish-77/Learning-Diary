PHASE 1 - CORE FUNDAMENTALS
Linux is not an OS but an kernal

User > Shell > Kernal > Hardware

Kernal - Heart of the machine, communicated directly with the Hardware
Shell - Listens commands from the user and then communicates with Kernal

PHASE 2 - PROCESS MANAGEMENT
Process - Program in execution
Program - passive entity like and instruction of code in your PROCESS

Process Example - 
ls > shells read ls > shell finds the binary of ls in $PATH > finds bin/ls > shell calls fork() >
fork() creates an child process > child process calls execve() > loads bin/ls into the child process memory > 
kernal allocates PID , Memory and file descriptor > Program runs > Program exits

$PATH - List of address where shell can look for 
fork() - Creates an duplcate process(child) of parent process 
execve() - Deletes the memory of the child process and then allocates the memory from the bin/ls 

User types "ls"
   ↓
Shell calls fork()
   ↓
Child process created
   ↓
Child calls exec()
   ↓
Child becomes "ls"
   ↓
ls runs and exits
   ↓
Parent shell continues
