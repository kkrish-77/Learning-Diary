How internet works?
user enters Google > Then browser checks in the cache for the dns > browser checks in the os cache > dns resolver resolves the ip address to the domain name > browser creates an TCP connection with server (3 way handshake) >
then http sends the request to the server > then server give data packets in the plain text to client  

HTTP - ➡️ It defines how requests and responses are formatted and transferred.
Its stateless in nature and sends plain txt request to the server.
Client sends https request > Server process the request > sends the http response to the client
